# Job-Postings
The purpose of this project was to perform data cleaning and an exploratory data analysis on a Job Postings dataset downloaded from Kaggle.com. I do not know where this dataset came from, or if it is based on real data. The purpose was simply to demonstrate abilities in Python and Data Analysis, with my thought process inserted throughout the code. The intent was to add context and clarity, hopefully it didn't achieve the opposite!
